// ######### ===>   Error Boundaries  <===##########

// Definition ==>>  Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child 
//                  component tree . log those errors and display a fallback UI instead of the componenet tree
//                  that crashed . Error boundaries catch errors during rendering , in lifecycle methods , and 
//                  in constructors of the whole tree below them .

// A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the  lifeCycle  methods 
// static getDerivedStateFromError()  or   componentDidCatch()  .

// Error Boundaries do not catch errors for :
// (1) =>>  Event Handlers .
// (2) =>>  Asynchronous code (like setTimeout , Callbacks etc)  .
// (3) =>>  Server-Side  rendering  .
// (4) =>>  Error throws in the error boundary itself ( rather than its Children )  .
