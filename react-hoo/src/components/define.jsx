// Hooks Definition =>>  Hooks  are  functions that let you "Hook into"  React state  and life-cycle features from 
//                        Function components.  hooks  allows  you to use  React  without classes . it means you
//                     can  use state  and other  React features  without  writting  a class . React provides a 
//                     few  built-in  Hooks like  useState ,  useEffect  etc . Hooks are new addition in React 16.8 . 


// when use Hooks ==>>  If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it . then use hooks .


// Rules of  Hooks ==>> 
// (1) =>   Only call  Hooks  at the top level - We should not call hooks inside loops , Conditions or  Nested
//           Functions . Instead always use hooks at the top level of your React Functions .
 
// (2) =>   Only call Hooks  from React Functions - We should not call hooks from regular Javascript Functions . 
// Instead call hooks from  React Function components  OR  call hooks from  Custom Hooks .
